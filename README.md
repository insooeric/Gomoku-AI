## Overview
This project is build in .NET 8, with two API endpoints that receives 2D Board, Depth/Iteration, and Rule. 
The project implements a Gomoku (also known as Five in a Row) game with following AI algorithms for move evaluation and selection:
1. **Monte Carlo Tree Search** and **Priority**
2. **Minimax**, **Alpha-beta puring**, and **Heuristic Scoring**

It also utilizes at least one of the following rules:
1. **Free Style Rule** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku/#Freestyle gomoku]
2. **Renju Rule** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku/#Renju]

## Structure
Followings are the core components:

1. **AIModels**  
   - **HMA-B/**: Includes logics and behaviours of Minimax Algorithm along with Alpha-beta puring with Heuristic scoring.
   - **MCTS/**: Includes logics and behaviours of Monte carlo tree search based on prioritized moves.

2. **RuleModels/** (Game Logic and AI)  
   - Provides all the logic for Free Style Rule as well as Renju Rule (e.g., forbidden moves such as overlines, double threes, double fours, etc.)
   - Checks for a winner, counts consecutive stones, and so on.

3. **Models**  
   - Defines the shape of the incoming request body (`List<List<int>> Board` for overall board, `Depth` for Minimax search depth and number of Monte Carlo Tree Search iteration).

## How It Works

### Entry
1. The client (or another application) sends a **POST** request to either:
   - `/api/gomoku/minimax-move` endpoint for Minimax.
   - `/api/gomoku/minimax-move` endpoint for Monte Carlo Tree Search.
2. The request must include a JSON body matching **InputModel**, which contains:
   - A 2D list (`List<List<int>>`) representing the board:
     - **0** indicates an empty cell.
     - **1** indicates a Black stone.
     - **-1** indicates a White stone.
   - An integer `Depth` used to potentially set:
        - The search depth for Minimax.
        - The iteration for Monte Carlo Tree Search

3. Based on the counts of Black (`1`) and White (`-1`) stones from the board, it automatically determines whose turn it is:
   - For any invalid or complete game, it returns ( `x: -1, y: -1`) with message and other params indicating it.
   - If there are more Black stones than White stones, it‚Äôs White‚Äôs turn (`-1`).
   - Otherwise, it‚Äôs Black‚Äôs turn (`1`).

### Restrictions
The endpoint will return **BadRequest** under following conditions:
1. If the board is null or empty
2. If the board dimensions are smaller than 7√ó7
3. If the board isn't rectangular
4. If the board contains invalid values (anything other than `0`, `1`, or `-1`)
5. If the difference between the number of Black and White stones exceeds `1`
6. If **Black** has made a forbidden move according to **Renju** rules
7. If the code detects multiple winners simultaneously

### Logical Process
1. **Check for a winner**  
   - Uses `HasWinner` to see if there is exactly one winner. If a winner is found, returns an **Ok** with winner's number (`1` for Black, `-1` for White) with  `"Black Wins üéâ"` or `"White Wins üéâ"`.
2. **Check for draw**  
   - If every cell is occupied and no winner is found, returns an **Ok** with `"It's a Draw ü§ù"`.
3. **Run AI**  
   - If the game is valid and ongoing, based on the API endpoint, the code runs either **Minimax** or **Monte Carlo Tree Search** logic with the appropriate player assignments (AI vs Human).
   - Then it performs followings:
        - Minimax: It runs `GetBestMove` to run Minimax move
        - Monte Carlo Tree Search: It runs `Search` to run MCTS move
   - Both returns `Move` for the best cell to place the next stone.

## Endpoints

### `POST /api/game/minimax-move`
### `POST /api/game/mcts-move`

**Description**:  
For both endpoints, given a Board, Depth, and RuleType, returns either:
- An error describing why the request is invalid, or  
- The best move for the next player (or a game over/draw response).

#### Request Body

```jsonc
{
    "Board": [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ],
    "Depth": 3,
    "RuleType": "freestyle" // or "renju"
}
```

- **Board**: A 2D array of integers.  
  - **0** = Empty cell  
  - **1** = Black stone  
  - **-1** = White stone  
- **Depth**: An integer controlling either the Minimax depth or a number of iterations for MCTS

#### Response

**On success** (and the game still in progress):
```jsonc
{
   Status: "Playing",
   X: 5,
   Y: 3,
   Color: "Black", // or "White"
   Message: "Playing"
}
```

**If the game is already won**:
```jsonc
{
   Status: "Win",
   X: 2,
   Y: 6,
   Color: "White", // always AI's color
   Message: "White Wins üéâ"
}
```

**If the game is a draw**:
```jsonc
{
   Status:"'Draw",
   X: -1,
   Y: -1,
   Color: "White", // always AI's color
   Message: "It's a Draw ü§ù"
}
```

**On invalid board**:
```jsonc
{
   Status: "Error",
   X: -1,
   Y: -1,
   Color: "White", // always AI's color
   Message: "Invalid board values. Only 0 (empty), 1 (black), and -1 (white) are allowed."
}
```

(Or another relevant message explaining the specific issue.)

## Notes on Rules

### Free Style Rule
- Black plays first, then white plays. Both players take turn until either one of the player connects more than 5 lines or the board is full, which is draw.
- There is no restriction for both Black and White players.

### Renju Rule
1. **Forbidden Moves for Black**:  
   - Overline (more than 5 in a row, e.g., 6, 7, ...).
   - Double-Three (a move that simultaneously creates two (or more) open three patterns).
   - Double-Four (a move that simultaneously creates two (or more) four-in-a-row patterns).

2. **White** has no forbidden moves.  

3. When **Black** violates any forbidden move condition, the game state is considered invalid in this API‚Äôs context, and a **BadRequest** is returned.
